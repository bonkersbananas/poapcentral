# POAP Central â€” Proof of POAP

Web app ðŸ‘‰ <https://poapcentral.xyz>

## What is this?

A web app to distribute POAPs to eligible users. Eligibility could be determined by checking what other POAPs an account may have collected â€“ Proof of POAP.

## Local Development

### Installation of Runtimes (macOS)

```bash
# frontend -> bun
brew tap oven-sh/bun
brew install bun

# backend -> dotnet-sdk
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
```

### Launching the Application

#### Frontend

```bash
# install dependencies
bun install --cwd frontend/

# disable telemetry (optional)
bun run astro telemetry disable

# run application
bun run --cwd frontend/ astro dev
```

#### Backend

```bash
# run application
dotnet watch --project backend/api/
```

## Project Plan (High Level)

### Step 0.5 - Event info

- Frontend fetch event info from backend

### Step 1 â€“ Basics of the Service

- Prove who the owner of the account is by signing a message (what should be signed?)
  - Advanced: Should signature be done using for example SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum)?
  - Simpler: We could have a simpler structure of signatures as well if the signature is only used to claim a POAP link.
- An administrator should be able to input POAP links to be dispensed
- An administrator of an event should be able to select which POAPs (if any) the account needs to have already received in order to be eligible for this POAP.
- Allow the logged in account to claim a POAP (by link?).
- When a POAP link has been distributed by our service weâ€™ll flag it as distributed so that it cannot be distributed again to any other user. We should also mark which account received which link.
- An account can only receive one distributed POAP link.
  - If the account tries to get the same POAP twice we could show the link that they have already received.

### Step 2 â€“ Proof of POAP

- Look up what POAPs the account owns
  - Check Gnosis Chain (contract: `0x22C1f6050E56d2876009903609a2cC3fEf83B415`) for POAPs that the account has already received.
  - Use Alchemy API to verify POAPs?
- Show apologetic text if the account is not allowed to claim this POAP.
  - Could happen if the account is not eligible for the POAP.
  - Could also be that case that all submitted POAP links have already been distributed.
- Display the POAP or provide a confirmation message to the logged-in account after they have successfully claimed a POAP by link.

## Basic Initial Components

- Frontend UI for users
  - Show link received by backend.
  - Request backend with accountâ€™s signature.
- Backend that distributed the links to POAPs
  - Store links in datastore.
  - Update information about links in datastore.
  - Provides an API for the frontend to use.
- Datastore that holds all the links and can store new links (+ metadata about them)

```

1. Frontend asks Alchemy about POAPs for the connected account.
2. Frontend requests a signature from the account.
3. Frontend sends the signature to backend.
4. Backend asks Alchemy about POAPs for the account that signed the message.
5. Backend fetches a link from the datastore and marks it as distributed and provides the link to the frontend.
6. Frontend shows the link (or redirects to POAP app for user to claim).
